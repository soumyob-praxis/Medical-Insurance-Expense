This repository is for regression based machine learning models that will aid in accurate cost estimation, risk assessment, and personalized premium determination, facilitating optimized resource allocation and informed decision-making in the insurance industry.
In this notebook I have tried to build regression based models that aims in forecasting how much people or groups will spend on healthcare by using past data and pertinent parameters like age, BMI, smoking status, and region we analyse trends and associations and build prediction models.
For insurance companies, customers, and medical professionals, these models can offer insightful data. Additionally, they can help in identifying variables that have a large impact on medical costs, assisting in the creation of healthcare strategies and interventions that are affordable.
